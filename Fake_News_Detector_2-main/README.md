## 📖 About the Project

This project is a **Fake News Detector** that classifies news articles or headlines as **FAKE**, **REAL**, or **UNCERTAIN** by combining large language model reasoning with real-time evidence retrieval from **Wikipedia**, **GNews**, and **trusted fact-checkers**.

Built using an **agentic RAG approach**, it ensures explainable, up-to-date, and reliable detection.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 Multi-source evidence retrieval (Wikipedia + GNews + extended sources)
- 🧠 Robust claim extraction and aggregation
- 🤖 LLM inference with Hugging Face's [Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1)
- 🔐 Secure user authentication (signup/login)
- 💻 Modern frontend UI with animated background
- 🧩 Modular and scalable backend (FastAPI-based)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python `3.8` or higher
- (Optional) Node.js and npm (for frontend customization/build)
- Internet connection (for API calls)
- API keys from:
  - [GNews](https://gnews.io/)
  - [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
  - [NewsAPI (Optional)](https://newsapi.org/)

---

### 📦 Virtual Environment Setup

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

🔐 Setting Environment Variables
Create a .env file in your project root and add:
```.env
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_together_api_key
GNEWS_API_KEY=your_gnews_api_key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_org_key   # Optional
```

🧬 Architecture & Flow
=>Backend Flow:

=>User submits text via /predict

=>Extract main claim

=>Retrieve real-time evidence from:

=>Wikipedia

=>GNews

=>NewsAPI (optional)

=>Compose chain-of-thought agentic prompt

=>Query Mixtral LLM for classification

=>Return verdict: ✅ REAL | ❌ FAKE | ❓ UNCERTAIN

=>Frontend displays result + explanation
